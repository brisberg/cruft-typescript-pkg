# Roadmap

### Wiki

Should probably add a cookiecutter flag for whether or not the repository needs to maintain their wiki within the Repo.

This flag will remove the `wiki/` directory and the `publish-wiki.yml` workflow.

Above is an example us a cookiecutter repository that uses such flags.

### Template Testing

Also would be nice to add a test case for this template itself, to make sure that it still works during updates.

See the above template for some ideas about how to do that.

### Meta-templates

I would also like to add a Meta-template for creating cookiecutter templates. That way all my templates stay in sync and fully featured.
